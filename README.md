# Dominos---Predictive-Purchase-Order-System
**📌 Project Description**

This project is a Predictive Purchase Order System designed for Domino’s to optimize inventory management. Using machine learning, it analyzes historical sales data to forecast demand and suggest optimal purchase orders, reducing waste and improving supply chain efficiency.

**🚀 Features**

📊 Predicts required inventory levels based on past purchase patterns.

🔍 Uses machine learning to optimize purchase order quantities.

🏬 Reduces food wastage and improves supply chain efficiency.

📈 Data-driven insights through visualizations and analytics.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

📦 Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)

📊 Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

🤖 Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

📄 Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)

**🔄 How It Works**

📥 Loads and preprocesses the dataset.

📊 Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends.

🤖 Trains a machine learning model to forecast demand.

✅ Generates purchase order recommendations.

📈 Visualizes insights for better decision-making.

**🔮 Future Improvements**
